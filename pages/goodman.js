Duct cleaning is required in cases like pets, water damage, smoking, or reconstruction of your property."] },
    { id: "faq-2", que: "Can you combine heating and cooling system?", ans: "Yes, you can combine a cooling and heating system. Through this, you can save a lot of money and space with one unit.

This allows you to run refrigerated air conditioning with the help of the same ducting and outlet systems.", list: null },

This allows the fluid to collect the thermal energy which is deposited in the earth from the sun.", list: null },
    { id: "faq-6", que: "How does ductless heating and cooling work?", ans: "It works by using heat exchanger coils to move warm air from one location to another. During winter, the heat pump draws warm air from outside your home to increase temperatures inside.
